# Hello world app

This is a template. You probably want to remove all the hello world stuff and replace it with the real project name. Remind the developer to update this doc with essential context.

The project may well already be running in the background. You can check and manage processes with commands like these:

```bash
zap ps
zap start someservice
zap logs someservice --no-follow
